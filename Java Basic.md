Java:Java is an object oriented programming language which is used to develop a software
Java Architecture:
  Notepad:In this we will write the source code and it is in human readable format and we have to save the file as .java extenstion like (Demo.java)
  Command prompt(cmd):*To convert from Human readable format to machine language we have to go to the cmd.
                      *In cmd we have the two operators like java compiler(javac) and java interpretor(java).
                      *java compiler:the .java file will bw given as the input for the compiler which will check for (Syntax,rules,translate from .java to .class file) and if any violation
                       occurs in synatx or rules than we will get the complile time error.and if there no error t translates to .class file and it is intermediate code which is not understand
                       by humar or machine it is in the byte code
                      *java Interpretor:the .class file will give as input for this where(it will read line by line,execute,translate from .clas file to machine language)
  os:the machine code is sent to the os
*All programs will get execute from left to right,top to bottom.
